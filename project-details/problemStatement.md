# Problem Statement

Environmental crimes like illegal sand mining and land encroachment operate at scale across jurisdictional boundaries, with violators strategically rotating operations.

Government enforcement agencies face three critical challenges:
1. Detecting violations too late to prevent damage.
2. Being overwhelmed by hundreds of low-priority alerts while critical cases go unaddressed.
3. Lacking visibility into cross-border operations where the same perpetrators exploit jurisdictional gaps.

## LandSentinel addresses this through an AI-powered predictive enforcement platform that:

1. **Predicts violations 2–3 weeks** in advance using LSTM-based temporal pattern analysis across multi-spectral satellite imagery.
2. **Intelligently prioritizes cases** through a multi-factor severity scoring engine.
3. **Identifies cross-jurisdictional criminal networks** by correlating violation patterns across state/national borders.

The system processes satellite data across multiple regions simultaneously, generates optimized inspection routes for field teams, and auto-routes alerts to the appropriate authorities.
