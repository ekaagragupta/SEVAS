# Proposed Solution (SEVAS)

#### Component A: Predictive Early Warning System

**Technology Stack:**
- **LSTM Networks** for temporal sequence analysis
- **Multi-spectral indices** (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI) tracking
- **Anomaly detection** algorithms for suspicious patterns
- **Time-series forecasting** for risk prediction

**How It Works:**
```txt
Input: 6 months of satellite imagery (monthly)
      ↓
Extract temporal features:
  - Vegetation health trends (NDVI decline)
  - Water body area changes (NDWI)
  - Built-up area expansion (NDBI)
  - Vehicle detection counts
  - Night-time light intensity
      ↓
LSTM Model analyzes patterns
      ↓
Output: Risk prediction 2-3 weeks ahead
  - Probability: 78% chance of violation
  - Warning signs: "Vegetation decline 23%, vehicle activity +340%"
  - Predicted timeline: "High risk period: Jan 15-30"

```

#### Component B: Intelligent Prioritization Engine

**Technology Stack:**
- **Multi-criteria decision analysis** (MCDA)
- **Graph algorithms** for route optimization
- **Severity scoring** with weighted factors
- **Resource allocation** optimization

**How It Works:**
```
Input: 500 detected/predicted violations
      ↓
Calculate priority score for each:
  
  Score = Σ (Factor_i × Weight_i)
  
  Factors:
  • Environmental Impact (30%): Proximity to protected areas, ecosystem sensitivity
  • Urgency (25%): Rate of expansion, predicted timeline
  • Legal Strength (20%): Evidence quality, GPS accuracy, image clarity
  • Public Safety (15%): Flood risk, infrastructure threat
  • Area Affected (10%): Hectares impacted
      ↓
Rank violations: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
      ↓
Generate optimized inspection routes
      ↓
Output: Actionable enforcement plan
  - "Inspect these 8 critical sites"
  - "Optimal route: 145km, 6 hours"
  - "Deadline: Next 72 hours"
```

**Unique Value:**
- **85% reduction** in wasted inspections
- **Resource optimization** for limited field teams
- **Higher conviction rates** focusing on strong cases

#### **Component C: Cross-Border Intelligence Network**

**Technology Stack:**
- **Multi-region satellite monitoring**
- **Pattern correlation algorithms**
- **Equipment signature matching** (CNN-based)
- **Network analysis** (graph theory)
- **Geospatial clustering** algorithms

**How It Works:**
```
Input: Violations from multiple states/districts
      ↓
Equipment Signature Analysis:
  - CNN extracts visual patterns (machinery type, excavation style)
  - Compare signatures across regions
  - Match probability: "87% similarity to Rajasthan Case #2847"
      ↓
Temporal Correlation:
  - Timeline analysis: Operations in Region A stop → Region B starts
  - Cyclic patterns: "Activity rotates every 3 months"
      ↓
Transport Route Tracking:
  - Vehicle movement between sites
  - Supply chain analysis
      ↓
Network Graph Construction:
  - Node: Violation site
  - Edge: Correlation strength
  - Clusters: Likely same operator
      ↓
Output: Criminal network intelligence
  - "Cluster 1: 23 sites across 3 states, coordinated operation"
  - "Alert: Haryana Forest Dept, Rajasthan Mining Dept, Central Bureau"
  - "Recommended: Joint task force"
```

**Unique Value:**
- **Exposes coordinated networks** impossible to see in single-jurisdiction view
- **Prevents displacement** (violators just moving, not stopping)
- **Enables joint enforcement** operations
